									<p>
										Audiomesh is an app that allows musicians to collaborate more easily with one-another. The app allows a musician to record ideas with their phone, and instantly sync those audio files to the cloud and with band members, much like Dropbox or Google Drive.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>UX Research</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This project was an entrepreneurial effort. I used my own frustrations and experiences as a musician to inform the core idea. I also sent out a survey to bands on Craigslist and Facebook. These bands ranged from garage bands, to famous modern rock bands. Questions on the survey included:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What percentage of your time is spent writing original music?
                                        Have you ever recorded yourself playing music?
                                        What physical equipment do you use to record yourself playing music?
                                        What software do you use to record yourself playing music?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once I had wire frames, I used the POP (Prototyping on Paper) app to guerilla test a few screens with musician friends.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                       I also conducted a competitive analysis with existing solutions. Most of these solutions were geared towards public collaboration with strangers. I assessed these platforms as well as messaged some of their users to understand mental models around collaboration.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The big turning point for me was when the results showed that a majority if people selected "Other" in regards to physical equipment and filled in the blank with "mobile phone." I was surprised that even big famous bands would use their phones to collaborate. 
                                    </p>

                                        The other surprise was what the software question revealed. Most people who used their phones also used the native iOS Voice Memos app. Both of these findings were surprising not just because of the time, but because there were myriad physical recording devices ranging from small handheld recorders with condenser microphones, to large usb audio interfaces. Why would anyone use the cheap, low-quality phone mic?

                                    </p>

                                        Based on these findings, I quickly pivoted my idea into a mobile app. From that point on it became a mix of development work and UX/UI. I started coding the app in Objective-C and built the backend on Parse. Currently I am re-building the app in Swift with a Firebase backend.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>UX Design</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I did numerous iterations on the original concept in Adobe Illustrator. Because I was also coding the app, I also iterated on the concept in Xcode's storyboards.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        I had tons of ideas for Audiomesh, but I reduced the app down to a couple core concepts: record audio, share audio privately, sync audio to the cloud. These are the primary use cases that require musicians to use multiple solutions. For example: Voice Memos for recording, email for sharing, and Dropbox for syncing.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The app is not finished. I am currently coding it in Swift. This will likely be a never-ending hobby project.
                                    </p>

                                        Other than icons (which were purchased from Creative Market), I did all graphic design for the user-interface as well as branding. Below are some old mockups I did. The UI has changed considerably since then. I have yet to update the mockups with the current UI.
                                    </p>
